Practicing Ruby Cookbook
========================

This Chef cookbook fully automates the process of setting up an environment that
can run the [Practicing Ruby Rails app][pr-web]. It takes a bare Ubuntu system
from zero to the point where Practicing Ruby can be deployed with Capistrano.

The cookbook was originally built for the Practicing Ruby article
["Infrastructure automation by example"][pr-article].

## Requirements

To use this cookbook, you need the following software:

* [VirtualBox] - Version 4.2 or higher
* [Vagrant] - Version 1.5 or higher
* [vagrant-omnibus] - installable via `vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus`
* [Berkshelf] - installable via `bundle install`

When you provision a VM using this cookbook, Chef will be installed for you via
`vagrant-omnibus`, and if necessary an Ubuntu Linux base system image will be
downloaded automatically. See the project's `Vagrantfile` for exact versions
used.

## External Cookbooks

Our recipes are built on top of the following external cookbooks: 

* [apt](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/apt)
* [database](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/database)
* [mailcatcher](https://github.com/andruby/mailcatcher)
* [nginx](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nginx)
* [postgresql](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/postgresql)
* [sudo](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/sudo)
* [user](https://github.com/fnichol/chef-user)

All of these will be automatically installed by **Berkshelf**, so there is no
need to set them up manually.

## Configuration

Most of the web application's features will work without modifying any settings,
but a few features do need to have valid API keys or other bits of configuration
data to be set in order to run. To see what options are configurable, see
`attributes/default.rb`. To override them, copy `chef.json.example` to
`chef.json` and edit the latter accordingly. *Keep in mind that for many use
cases, you may not need to override any settings at all.*

## Provisioning

Run the following two commands inside the Practicing Ruby cookbook to create a
Vagrant machine and boot it up:

    $ bundle exec berks vendor vendor/cookbooks
    $ vagrant up --provision

In case the VM is already up, you can always run Chef again with:

    $ bundle exec berks vendor vendor/cookbooks
    $ vagrant provision

To SSH into the running VM:

    $ vagrant ssh

Last but not least, here is how to stop and destroy the VM when you no longer
need it or when you want to start from scratch:

    $ vagrant destroy -f

### Using Rake

Instead of running Vagrant directly on the command line, there is also a Rake
task you can use. With this command, you always end up with a Vagrant machine
that is fully provisioned:

    $ bundle exec rake provision

## Deploying

In order to deploy the Practicing Ruby app to a Vagrant VM that was provisioned
with the Practicing Ruby cookbook, you have to add the following settings to
your `~/.ssh/config` file (you might have to adapt `HostName` and `IdentityFile`
to match your setup).

```
Host practicingruby.local
    HostName 10.11.12.13
    User deploy
    UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    PasswordAuthentication no
    IdentityFile ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```

Afterwards, you will be able to deploy the Rails app with Capistrano:

    $ cd /path/to/practicing-ruby-web
    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec cap vagrant deploy:setup deploy seed

Also, you will be able to log into the VM via `ssh practicingruby.local`.

To visit the site from your browser, you'll probably also need to add the
following entries to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
10.11.12.13 practicingruby.local
10.11.12.13 www.practicingruby.local
```

A few users and some articles will already be populated in the DB. Try logging
in as `admin` for an administrator account, and see the [full seed file][pr-seeds]
for all created users.

### Using Rake

Instead of manually switching to the `practicing-ruby-web` directory and running
Capistrano, you can also use this handy Rake task to deploy the Rails app to the
Vagrant machine:

    $ bundle exec rake deploy

## Testing

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elm-city-craftworks/practicing-ruby-cookbook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elm-city-craftworks/practicing-ruby-cookbook)

The following Rake tasks are provided for automated testing of the cookbook:

* `rake rubocop` - Run [RuboCop] style and lint checks
* `rake foodcritic` - Run [Foodcritic] lint checks
* `rake integration` - Run [Test Kitchen] integration tests (provisions a
  Vagrant VM using this cookbook and then tests the infrastructure with
  [Serverspec])
* `rake test` - Run all tests
